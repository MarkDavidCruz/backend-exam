Welcome to the Node.js CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) examination. This examination is designed to assess your ability to build a basic CRUD application using Node.js.
To complete this examination, you should have a basic understanding of Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. You should also be familiar with RESTful APIs and CRUD operations.
Here are the instructions for completing this examination:
1.	Fork and clone the repository provided.
2.	Create a MongoDB database for the application.
3.	Create a Node.js and Express.js server that listens on a specified port.

•	Update existing data in the database
•	Delete data from the database
5.	Write tests for the API using a testing framework of your choice.
6.	Commit and push your code to the repository.
7.	Deploy the application to a cloud provider of your choice (e.g., Heroku, AWS, GCP, etc.).
8.	Send the URL of the deployed application and the link to the GitHub repository to the examiners.

Here are some additional guidelines for completing the examination
•	Use best practices when writing your code, such as modularizing your code, error handling, and code comments.
